## Features
- In the code, the game table is represented as a **normal one dimensional** c++ vector, instead of two dimensional c++ vectors.<br/>
  So I used mathematical operations to get the x,y coordinates of the table.
- At the option button you can set the **background color**, **cell color** and even the **size of the table**.
